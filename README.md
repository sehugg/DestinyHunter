
DHUNTERPET.PRG for Commodore PET
DHUNTERC64.PRG for Commodore C64

When the game starts, just press any key to decide
a DIRECTION and ring CHIMES.  Eventually you will be asked
to press RETURN to continue (or press X to choose DIRECTION
and CHIMES again).

DIRECTION is mostly cosmetic (e.g. character will be FILLED 
circle or HOLLOW circle).  CHIMES are used to be gifted
BLESSINGS or PERSISTENCY at the start of the game.  These are
not essential, but having them will help reaching the end easier.
(BLESSINGS slow down the creatures, while PERSISTENCY recover HEALTH)

If using real/physical Commodore hardware, both versions support
the SNES GAMEPAD adapter that is available here:

Commodore PET CONTROLS:
(if playing on a laptop that has no NUMPAD, I apologies for the
inconvenience - the VICE emulator has provisions for remapping keys;
you may consider trying the C64 version instead)

SPACE    = FIRE ARROW
           Must have some arrows collected.  When
				  	run out of arrows, spirits will gift
					 another set (but you must go collect them)

W/A/S/D  = MOVEMENT UP/LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT

NUMPAD
4/6      = AIM BOW LEFT/RIGHT
           (first acquire bow on first map)
					
NUMPAD 0 = USE PERSISTENCY
            (PERSISTENCY is like a healing potion, used
						one PERSISTENCY to recover back 1 HEALTH)
						
NUMPAD 8 = "FLIP" BOW (180 degrees)
           This is earned after about 200 steps (movements).
					 Use this to quickly aim in the opposite direction.

B        = USE A BLESSINGS
           These are gifted from the spirit, and they slow down
					 all the current creatures on the map (by roughly a factor of 2).
					 
O        = ACTIVE THE ORB
           There is only one ORB in the game.  It is quite visible,
					 but I leave it as a surprise to players to find it.
					 You may only activate it once!  It will basically give you
					 unlimited STAMINA.

P       = PAUSE (press RETURN to resume)


				
C64 CONTROLS
============
Since the C64 has no NUMPAD, the only difference in the controls
for the C64 is:

J/L     = AIM BOW LEFT/RIGHT

I       = "FLIP" BOW
K       = USE PERSISTENCY

(all other keys remain the same as the PET version)

NOTE: The C64 version does support the C64 JOYSTICK in PORT #2,
which is also supported by VICE emulator (I use a NES USB gamepad).
JOYSTICK controls will take a little getting used to.  

MOVEMENT-MODE
D-PAD    = MOVEMENT  (when not HOLDING the button)
BUTTON 1 = FIRE ARROW

ACTION-MODE
HOLD BUTTON 1

When in ACTION-MODE:
D-PAD LEFT/RIGHT = AIM BOW
D-PAD UP         = USE PERSISTENCY
D-PAD DOWN       = FLIP BOW
D-PAD DOWN (2x)  = CANCEL FIRING ARROW
