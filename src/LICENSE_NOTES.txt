
   Thank You for taking time to try my game!  While it is a short
   game, such was the limitations of making a self-contained program
   with no external files and only 32K RAM.

   I wonder who will be first to find the orb!?

   Screenshot your End Game with the time score!  Perhaps at the 
   website we will make a list of the best times per persona.

   I consider this a BETA release.  The license below permits you
   to copy the game, to as many devices and friends as you desire.
   But technically this text file must be included, to clarify that
   I am the owner of the copyright and trademarks.

   Thank You again,
   v*
