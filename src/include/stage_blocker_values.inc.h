DATA ARRANGEMENT NOTES

blockers_stage1_values

  X/Y PAIRS of 8-bits corresponding to absolute screen coordinates that are blocked from movement (boulders, rocks, etc.)
  To improve performance, not every terrain TYPE is automatically a blocker.  By smartly placing blockers,
  players (and challenges) can't reach certain blocks, so implicitly those don't need to be checked.  We define blockers as
  just outlines of block points.
  
  Each map is limited to MAX_BLOCKER_ENTRIES while editing - this is somewhat artificial limit, and is due to how the
  code to save maps is arranged -- it counts and buffers up blockers while doing the RLE compression.  It could just output
  them, but then that would mingle in the disk writing code with that processing code.
