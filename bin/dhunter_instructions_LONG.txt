Introduction
============
Destiny Hunter begins with a mysterious character
creation sequence!  Fate decides whether you follow the
direction of LINGA or YONI.  You have some limited
influence, by pressing the SPACEBAR (or really
any key, but I recommend SPACEBAR).

To learn more about Linga and Yoni, I suggest
starting with the following:
https://www.hinduwebsite.com/history/yin-and-yang-and-the-hindu-connection.asp

Following this, there are EIGHT CHIMES.  Similarly
ring each CHIME by pressing SPACEBAR.  It may not 
look like much, but these chimes are deciding
if you'll receive a Blessing!

Sometimes the chimes will be indecisive, which
means they are consulting a second opinion.
During these moments, you'll receive a Persistency
award while awaiting their decision.

Once all the chimes are decided, you then have
a last moment to make a very fateful decision:
embrace this chosen destiny, or re-roll.


Personas!
=========
The next task is to choose your Persona!  

Personas reflect your spirtial connection to
an ancient hunter.  They will be involved
in your adventure. 

To speak in the more traditional ways,
the persona decides the difficulty of your
adventure.  Choose accordingly to your skill
(and how much coffee you've had recently!)


Introduction (again)
============
Take heed of these instructions!  They
tell you how to play the game.  As that is
important, it is worth repeating:

- W/A/S/D movement keys
your character UP, LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN respectively.

Once you have your hunting weapon:
- 4 rotates your weapon LEFT    (J on C64)
- 6 rotates your weapon RIGHT   (L on C64)
- 8 is a FLIP skill that you learn later  (I on C64)

Once you have arrows for your hunting weapon:

- SPACEBAR to fire said arrows.

Then there are two special abilities:

- B for Blessings!  (if you have any)
     These slow down the CHALLENGES in the STAGE

- P for Persistency  (again, if you have any)
     These HEAL your HEALTH.

- F to FINISH a stage and go to the next one
     once all the challenges are defeated.


In addition, the introduction orients
you with the variety of terrain you
are likely to find along your way.

- WATER - observe keenly, it sparkles
as you walk within it!

- BEACH - it's very bright

- GRASS - it may look like a big X, but it's grass!

- LAND - technically it is called SPACE, but
        I felt that would cause confusion - this is
        not a space game!

- ROCKS  in general, you can't move through 
         rocks. But there could be exceptions!
         (just not in this DEMO!)


STAMINA
=======
Ah, here is your reward for "RTFM" !  Due to 
memory limitations, stamina is not described 
in the game.  You'd be surprised how much 
computer RAM memory English text quickly consumes!

Stamina is your energy.  Just as in real life,
running and exerting yourself will consume
stamina.  This is as close as 1979 computer
technology got to Virtual Reality!

Let's go GEEK and describe Stamina like we're an RPG:

You have 1000 total stamina points.  (in this DEMO!)

For each movement, you will lose 60*V points
of stamina on land, and 90*V points in water.
And to clarify about land, I mean: NOT water.

What's V? Well, it's a factor based on your 
chosen persona corresponding land and water skills.
Let's call it a Vitality factor, and that's 
all I'm going to say about that.

Firing your arrow cost 1D300+100 points of stamina.
(yes, D here means DIE roll - computers are
awesome at having very massive dice!)

If your energy drops below 0, you can't move until
it recovers above 200.  This is called REST mode.

Each 1/8th of a second you will recover 1D200
points of energy.

You have a little stamina bar on the screen.  
Don't run out, or you can't move for awhile.  
You'll run out faster while in water.

And that's about sums it up for stamina!



THE STAGES
==========

After a brief introduction, you will then 
begin your adventure in what is called
THE STAGES.  (no ma'am, in this house we
do NOT call them Levels! Don't you dare!)

Each stage will have its name on the top
right.  

You complete a stage by activating and
defeating a number of Challenges.

When you've completed, a big "F" appears
reminding you that you can now press F
to "finish" the stage and proceed to the 
next one.  It is done this way in case
you want to explore something about the 
stage first.  HINT: Only one stage
really has a hidden secret!


CREDITS
=======

The game concept and the programming is all my work,
from an empty "int main()" to the functional
game you can now experience, and multiple drafts
of the story across the stages (which there is
actually a story!).  This manual, the stage 
design and stage editing tool, all my creation.  

That said, this simply would not have been possible
without a few things:

- The creators of cc65, a C compiler for the 6502

- The creators of DirMaster, that allow me to read
  Commodore D64 files from Windows and copy and paste
  the contents.  

- "The 8-Bit Guy" (creator of PETSCII Robots) who 
  inspired me to soldier on and actually complete this project!

- Google did help me find some technical resources
  about the Commodore PET address space.  Specially the 
  Jiffy counter, key press polling, video address.
  www.zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/PETx/petmem.txt  

- and I'd like to give a salute to Chuck Peddle, for
  his efforts in creating the 6502 processor, and
  pioneering the path of Personal Computers in the mid-1970s!
  He was indeed a solid character.

I spent quite a bit of time wrestling with and understanding
the standard vs extended "graphics" mode, and corresponding 
characters sets, of the PET.  I get a chuckle out of
visualizing Chuck and his son coming up with that character set!

Figuring out the Jiffy timer was also fun, it was essential
for getting a tempo to the game.

My main pride is in the strategy I came up with to 
do the flicker free animation over a populated background.  
We take so much for granted in modern programming, with 
many GHz and GBs at our disposal.  It's very humbling 
to work with extremely limited sources, and I got a 
taste of the ingenuity those early 1980s software pioneers 
had to posses to make usable software products of that era.
Every single byte truly matter, as code-space compete with
your available resident RAM.  I haven't had to think
about the compiled size of my code in years!

LICENSING
=========


   Thank You for taking time to try my game!  While it is a short
   game, such was the limitations of making a self-contained program
   with no external files and only 32K RAM.

   I wonder who will be first to find the orb!?

   Screenshot your End Game with the time score!  Perhaps at the 
   website we will make a list of the best times per persona.

   For future updates, or to provide comments/feedback, refer to:

   contact.steve.usa@gmail.com

   The license below permits you to copy the game, to as many devices 
   and friends as you desire. But technically this text file must be included, 
   to clarify that I am the owner of the copyright.

   Thank You again,
   v*

********
SPOILERS - inside scoop
********

GO NO FURTHER!  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

- The introduction sequence is intended to initialize
  the random number generator.  By the user pressing
  SPACE at somewhat random times, as well as during
  each of the chimes, it compiles together a set of SEED
  VALUES that are totaled up to seed that random number
  generator.

- Inside the code itself, I give each challenge a name
  that starts with J.  The default character names also
  start with J.  It's just a thing I started doing with
  this project, no real reason for choosing J.

  - The rats are JACK the younger (he moves faster), and JONAS
  - The two sphynxs are JOSEPH and JIMMY - JIMMY is the one out 
    of control, moving as fast as possible.

- There is one use for a Blessing:
  they will slow down the challenges 
  by a factor of 2.

- Instead of using the terms male/female, I chose to use
  the term Direction.  I didn't want to focus on the gender
  aspect.  I wanted to express that the differences 
  between these is beyond just biological gender, but
  there is a kind of "spiritual" difference in sentiments
  and way of thinking.  And I think that's a form of 
  diversity that is part of the balance of life (that balance
  is reflected in yoni/linga, a kind of precursor to ying/yang).
  At the very least, my hope is just mentioning these concepts
  inspires folks to consider learning about things beyond
  typical Western perspectives.  

- There is some logic behind the chimes.  Your first Direction
  decision establishes your MOD_VALUE (1-10).  Then based on
  your direction, your seed values will either INCREASE or
  DECREASE (that was really the original reason it was
  called Direction, as it literally decided which direction
  the numbers rolled).  The SEED_VALUE for that CHIME is
  MODDED (%) with your MOD_VALUE.  If that is equals 0, you
  get an "AGAIN" notice.  Your Persistence gift is the total
  number of AGAINs.  BUT - your MOD_VALUE gravitates towards
  being the value of 5 (neutral) after several CHIMES.  If 
  the number of AGAIN tries exceeds the current MOD_VALUE, 
  that's how you get a Blessing!

- If you run out of arrows in this, more will 
  randomly respawn.  Just go collect them.

- I didn't want to use the term Creatures or Monsters
  in this game, instead I just refer to them as
  Challenges.  

- The mobile challenges move between a few chosen
  TARGET points.  BUT, they may randomly change
  their mind on which target they are going towards.
  The intended game mechanic will be that your
  characters Stealth value will get interpreted
  as a Scent value by these challenges.  In otherwords,
  more Stealth and the challenges won't detect
  as easily (by just not being as far of range).
  BUT if they do attack you, they'll change mode
  and go after you -- then return to patrolling their
  TARGET points if you get out of "Stealth" range.
  (in otherwords, internally, your Stealth value
  will get inverted and becomes a Sense attribute
  for the challenges)

That's all :)
